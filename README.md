## Getting Started

### 1. Set Up Your Accounts

- Follow the instructions in `setup-openai-key.pdf` to create an OpenAI account and API key.
- Use `setup-hf-account.pdf` to set up your Hugging Face account.

### 2. Create a Simple Chatbot

Once you have your Hugging Face account:
- Follow the steps in `chatbot.pdf` to create your first AI assistant.
- Experiment with different prompts to customize your chatbot's behavior.

### 3. Try Prompt Engineering

- Open `ExamplePrompt.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
- Replace "your-key-goes-here" with your actual OpenAI API key.
- Run the notebook to see an example of prompt engineering in action.

## Tips for Beginners

- Start with simple prompts and gradually increase complexity.
- Experiment with different phrasings to see how they affect the AI's responses.
- Remember that AI models have limitations and may sometimes produce incorrect or biased information.

## Safety and Ethics

- Keep your API keys secure and never share them publicly.
- Be mindful of the credits you add to your OpenAI account to avoid unexpected charges.
- Consider the ethical implications of AI usage and strive for responsible application.

## Final Words 

Happy learning, and enjoy your journey into the world of AI!
